## 🎯 **Next Steps for You**

Follow the instructions in `STRIPE_FEATURES_SETUP_GUIDE.md`:
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Products → Features
2. Create each of the 8 features listed above
3. Note down the feature IDs and price IDs

### 2. **Update Configuration**
After creating features, update `config/stripe-features.ts`:
```typescript
"custom_branding": {
  "featureId": "feat_ACTUAL_STRIPE_ID", // Replace with real ID
  "priceId": "price_ACTUAL_STRIPE_ID",   // Replace with real ID
  // ... rest of config
}
```

### 3. **Link Features to Bot Products**
For each of your 14 bot products:
1. Go to the bot product in Stripe Dashboard
2. Click "Add features"
3. Select relevant features for that bot
4. Set pricing for each feature

### 4. **Update Checkout System**
Replace separate add-on products with features:
```typescript
// Old approach (separate products)
const lineItems = [
  { price: botPriceId, quantity: 1 },
  { price: addonPriceId, quantity: 1 }
];

// New approach (features)
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  line_items: [{ price: botPriceId, quantity: 1 }],
  features: [
    { feature: 'feat_custom_branding_id' },
    { feature: 'feat_voicebot_integration_id' }
  ]
});
```
