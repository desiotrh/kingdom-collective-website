## 📦 Package Installation

### Root package.json (✅ Declared)

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "husky": "^8.0.3",
    "@commitlint/cli": "^18.4.3",
    "@commitlint/config-conventional": "^18.4.3",
    "lint-staged": "^15.2.0",
    "bundlesize": "^0.18.1",

  }
}
```

**Status**: ⏳ Installing now (`npm install` running in background)

---

## ⚡ What Works RIGHT NOW (No Additional Steps Needed)

### 1. GitHub Actions ✅

**Push to main or create a PR and you'll see:**

- Automated CI/CD pipeline runs
- Security scans execute
- Lighthouse tests your performance
- Results comment on your PR

**Next push triggers everything!**

### 2. Dependabot 🔴 (DISABLED for Development)

**Intentionally disabled** to keep development easy and consistent:

- No automated dependency update PRs during development
- You control when to update dependencies
- Will enable before production launch

**To enable later**: See `.github/README.md` for instructions

### 3. CODEOWNERS ✅

**Starting with your next PR:**

- Required reviewers auto-assigned
- Can't merge without approvals
- Security files need 2 approvals

---

## 🎯 To Fully Activate (After npm install Completes)

### Step 1: Initialize Husky

```bash
npm run prepare
```

**This activates**:

- Pre-commit hook (lint + typecheck)
- Pre-push hook (test + build)
- Commit-msg hook (format validation)

### Step 2: Test Git Hooks

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: activate kingdom development tools"
```

**You should see:**

```
🔍 Running pre-commit checks...
📝 Type checking...
✅ Pre-commit checks passed!
📝 Validating commit message...
✅ Commit message format valid!
```

### Step 3: Push to GitHub

```bash
git push origin main
```

**Watch in GitHub Actions tab:**

- CI/CD Pipeline runs
- Lighthouse CI tests performance
- Security scan checks for vulnerabilities
- All results visible in ~10 minutes
