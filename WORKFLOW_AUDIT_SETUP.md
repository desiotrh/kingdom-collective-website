## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot connect to localhost:XXXX"

**Solution**: Start the app on that port

```bash
cd your-app
npm run start
```

### Issue: "Test timeout"

**Solution**: Increase timeout or check if app is responding

```typescript
test.setTimeout(120000); // 2 minutes
```

### Issue: "Element not found"

**Solution**: Use better selectors or add waits

```typescript
await page.waitForSelector("button");
const exists = await page
  .getByRole("button")
  .isVisible({ timeout: 5000 })
  .catch(() => false);
```
