## 📱 Testing Priority Order

### 1. **Critical Path Testing** (Must Work)

- [ ] User registration and login
- [ ] Basic content generation (Instagram posts)
- [ ] Platform selection functionality
- [ ] Faith mode toggle and content

### 2. **Core Features Testing** (Should Work)

- [ ] Advanced content options (tone, length, subtype)
- [ ] Template system (browse, select, use)
- [ ] Favorites system (save, retrieve)
- [ ] Content refinement (improve, shorten, expand)

### 3. **Polish Testing** (Nice to Have)

- [ ] UI/UX consistency
- [ ] Loading states and animations
- [ ] Error handling and messages
- [ ] Performance optimization

## 🎯 Success Criteria for Phase 2

### Functional Requirements ✅

- **Authentication**: Complete registration → login → session persistence flow
- **Content Generation**: All platforms produce appropriate, high-quality content
- **Templates**: Browsable, selectable, and generate relevant content
- **Favorites**: Reliable save/retrieve functionality
- **Refinement**: Noticeable content improvements

### Technical Requirements ✅

- **Performance**: <3 seconds content generation, <100ms UI responses
- **Stability**: No crashes during normal usage
- **Backend**: All API endpoints functional and tested
- **Frontend**: All screens navigate properly

### Design Requirements ✅

- **Branding**: Consistent Kingdom Studios visual identity
- **Usability**: Intuitive flow requiring minimal learning
- **Accessibility**: Clear labels, appropriate touch targets
- **Responsiveness**: Works across different device sizes

## 🐛 Expected Areas for Feedback

### Likely Refinement Areas

- **Content Quality**: AI-generated content tone and relevance
- **UI Flow**: Navigation efficiency and user experience
- **Feature Discoverability**: How easily users find advanced options
- **Performance**: Content generation speed optimization
- **Faith Integration**: Balance of spiritual and business content

### Known Limitations (To Address in Phase 3)

- **Mock Database**: Using temporary storage (will migrate to MongoDB Atlas)
- **Mock AI**: Fallback system active (will add production OpenAI key)
- **Limited Platforms**: Can expand social media integrations
- **No Direct Posting**: Currently generate-only (social posting in Phase 4)
