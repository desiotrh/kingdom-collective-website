## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Integration Architecture

```typescript
// Tier System Context Integration
const {
  currentTier,
  tierFeatures,
  checkFeatureAccess,
  trackUsage,
  getUsageStats,
  isTrialActive,
} = useTierSystem();

// Feature Access Control
const handleFeatureAccess = async (featureKey: string, action: string) => {
  const hasAccess = await checkFeatureAccess(featureKey);
  if (!hasAccess) {
    setShowUpgradeModal(true);
    return false;
  }
  await trackUsage("studio_name", action);
  return true;
};
