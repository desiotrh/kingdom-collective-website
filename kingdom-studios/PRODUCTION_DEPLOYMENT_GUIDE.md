## 🔧 Deployment Steps

### 1. Frontend Deployment (React Native + Expo)

#### Option A: Expo Application Services (EAS) - Recommended
```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g @expo/eas-cli

# Login to your Expo account
eas login

# Configure EAS build
eas build:configure

# Create production build
eas build --platform all --profile production

# Submit to app stores
eas submit --platform ios
eas submit --platform android
```

#### Option B: Manual Build
```bash
# iOS Build
npx expo run:ios --configuration Release

# Android Build  
npx expo run:android --variant release
```

### 2. Backend Deployment

#### Option A: Railway (Recommended for Node.js)
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Navigate to backend directory
cd ../kingdom-studios-backend

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway link [your-project-id]
railway up

# Set environment variables in Railway dashboard
```

#### Option B: Render
```bash
# Connect GitHub repository to Render
# Set build command: npm install
# Set start command: npm start
# Configure environment variables
```

#### Option C: Fly.io
```bash
# Install Fly CLI
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh

# Initialize and deploy
fly launch
fly deploy
```

### 3. Database Setup (MongoDB Atlas)

```bash
# Run database optimization
node database-optimizer.js

# Verify indexes are created
# Configure connection string in production
```

### 4. Environment Variables

#### Frontend (.env)
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
EXPO_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

#### Backend (.env)
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3001
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://[username]:[password]@[cluster].mongodb.net/[database]
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend-domain.com
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Performance Monitoring
- Real-time performance metrics implemented
- Error tracking with Sentry integration ready
- User analytics with Firebase/custom solution

### Health Checks
```bash
# Backend health check
curl https://your-backend-url.com/health

# Performance validation
curl https://your-backend-url.com/api/performance/stats
```

## 🚀 Launch Strategy

### Phase 1: Staging Deployment
