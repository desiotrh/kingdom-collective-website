### Our Approach to AI: A Tool, Not a Substitute

AI can be helpful—but it is only a tool. It should never replace your vision, your ideas, or your voice. As creators, small business owners, and builders, help can be useful at times—but your calling comes from God. He gives blueprints, purpose, and direction. AI should never replace God, Jesus, or the Holy Spirit.

- Use these apps with wisdom.
- Let AI assist, not lead.
- Always pause and reflect to ensure you’re aligned with what you’re called to do.

### How We Use AI (Across Website and Apps)
- AI is opt-in and assistive, not automatic or directive.
- You remain the author; AI can suggest, but you decide.
- We encourage brief reflection before and after AI usage to strengthen your unique voice.

### Pause & Reflect (Built-in Guidance)
Before you generate:
- What’s the goal, and who is this for?
- What would you create without AI?
- What’s the unique angle or testimony you bring?

After you generate:
- What will you change so it truly sounds like you?
- Does this reflect your values and calling?
- What would God have you emphasize?

### Short Versions (for banners, modals, settings)
- Banner: “AI is a tool—not your voice. Pause, reflect, and lead your vision.”
- Modal title: “Pause & Reflect”
- Modal body: “AI can assist, but your calling and voice lead. Take a moment to align your intent, then proceed with wisdom.”
- Settings note: “AI Assist is optional. Keep your voice first, use AI second.”

### Safeguards That Align With Our Mission
- Reflect-first, accept-last
  - Pre-generate “Pause & Reflect” (5–20s, skippable) with 2–3 intent prompts.
  - Post-generate “Confirm & Edit” step: require a brief tweak or “what I changed” note before saving.

- Human-first defaults
  - Coach Mode (default): frameworks/templates first, AI suggestion second.
  - Express Mode (opt-in): post-generate reflection only, for speed when needed.
  - “Continue without AI” always available and visible.

- Gentle, non-punitive nudges
  - After several AI uses in a row, soft reminder: “Try your voice first—what’s the core message?”
  - Optional “Quiet hours” and “Focus mode” to temporarily hide AI UI (user-controlled).

- Provenance and transparency
  - Label outputs “AI-assisted” vs “Human-led + AI-polish.”
  - Keep a simple “What changed” history so users see their contribution.

- Brand & voice strengthening (privacy-first)
  - Save reflection notes locally to build a personal “Brand & Voice” profile that personalizes suggestions.
  - Opt-in sync to account; default is local-only.

- Faith-alignment cues
  - Optional “Faith-first” prompts: “Does this honor your calling?” “What scripture or testimony informs this?”
  - Never forced; user/app toggle.

- Community and collaboration boundaries
  - No AI auto-replies in community/chat (Circle).
  - Human moderation cues for sensitive content; AI may assist triage but never posts.

- Publish/review gates (creator in control)
  - Before publish/export: quick checklist (audience, goal, alignment, edits made).
  - No auto-publish from AI outputs.

- Privacy and safety by design
  - No client-side secret keys; use backend for privileged tasks.
  - Prefer on-device features (e.g., TTS) when possible.

- Light analytics (opt-in, private)
  - Track “reflected vs skipped” and “human edits made” to improve UX—not to penalize.
  - Weekly recap highlighting the user’s evolving angles/style.

### Per-App Emphasis
- Studios, Launchpad (most AI): full pre+post checkpoints, Coach Mode by default, publish checklist.
- Voice: pre-transcription intent + post-edit reflection; “distraction-free journaling” mode.
- Clips: pre-gen intent + post-pick edit; emphasize manual brand kit first.
- Lens: prompt gallery as guidance; avoid auto-enhance by default; “shoot planning” checklist.
- Circle: human-led prompts; no AI posting; reflection for challenge creators only.
