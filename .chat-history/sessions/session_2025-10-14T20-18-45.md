## Changes Made

### 1. Chat History Tracking System

- Created `.chat-history/` folder structure
- Implemented manual session logger (`session-log.js`)
- Implemented automatic git-integrated logger (`session-logger-hook.js`)
- Created comprehensive README and CHANGELOG
- Added `npm run log:session` command

### 2. External Drive Verification

- Fixed git safe directory for external drive at `D:\Kingdom Studios App`
- Verified all scripts work from external drive
- Created 4 documentation files for external drive usage
- Confirmed all paths are relative (no hardcoded paths)

### 3. Localhost:3000 Testing Infrastructure

- Created complete testing folder structure
- Implemented 5 test types (health, API, integration, E2E, performance)
- Configured Jest with custom setup
- Created quick test utility for fast verification
- Added load testing with Autocannon
- Added stress testing capabilities
- Created 400+ line comprehensive testing guide

### 4. Workflow Audit System (Main Achievement)

- Created Playwright configuration for all 8 apps
- Wrote test specifications for each app:
  - Kingdom Studios (15 tests)
  - Kingdom Circle (community features)
  - Kingdom Clips (video platform)
  - Kingdom Launchpad (project management)
  - Kingdom Lens (content discovery)
  - Kingdom Stand (advocacy)
  - Kingdom Voice (journaling)
  - Kingdom Website (marketing)
- Implemented custom markdown reporter
- Created report generator script
- Added 11 new audit commands to package.json

### 5. Documentation

- Created comprehensive INDEX.md navigation hub
- Wrote 400+ line workflow audit guide
- Created quick start guides for all systems
- Cross-referenced all documentation
- Updated INDEX.md with all new systems

### 6. Testing Execution

- Installed Playwright browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Started Kingdom Studios on localhost:8081
- Ran first workflow audit successfully
- Generated comprehensive markdown report
- Identified 2 issues to fix (login redirect, 404 page)

## Key Decisions

### 1. Testing Framework Choices

- **Jest** for localhost API testing (fast, familiar)
- **Playwright** for workflow audits (reliable, cross-browser)
- **Autocannon** for performance testing (high-performance)

### 2. Project Organization

- Separate `testing/` for localhost tests
- Separate `tests/workflow-audits/` for Playwright tests
- Keep reports auto-generated and git-ignored
- Use relative paths for external drive compatibility

### 3. Port Assignments

- Backend: 3000
- Kingdom Studios: 8081
- Kingdom Circle: 8082
- Kingdom Clips: 8083
- Kingdom Launchpad: 8084
- Kingdom Lens: 8085
- Kingdom Stand: 8086
- Kingdom Voice: 8087
- Kingdom Website: 19006

### 4. Test Coverage Strategy

- 6 test categories per app:
  - Navigation tests
  - Authentication & protection
  - Button & form actions
  - Complete workflows
  - Error handling
  - Accessibility

### 5. Reporting Approach

- Multiple formats: Markdown + HTML + JSON
- Auto-fix suggestions in reports
- Screenshots for failures
- Custom reporter for comprehensive markdown

## Issues Resolved

### 1. External Drive Git Warning

- **Issue**: Git showed "dubious ownership" warning
- **Fix**: Added `git config --global --add safe.directory 'D:/Kingdom Studios App'`
- **Result**: Git now works correctly on external drive

### 2. Playwright Not Installed

- **Issue**: Tests failed with missing browser error
- **Fix**: Ran `npx playwright install`
- **Result**: Installed Chromium (144.4 MB), Firefox (92.1 MB), WebKit (57.1 MB)

### 3. PowerShell mkdir Syntax

- **Issue**: Unix-style mkdir failed on Windows
- **Fix**: Used `New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force` for PowerShell
- **Result**: Directories created successfully

## Testing Performed

### 1. Localhost Testing Setup

- Created test infrastructure
- Configured Jest
- Set up test environment variables
- Verified test scripts execute

## Next Steps

### Immediate

1. **Fix failed tests**:
   - Add authentication redirect for protected routes
   - Create 404/not-found page component
   - Re-run tests to verify fixes

2. **Run audits on other apps**:
   - Start remaining apps on their ports
   - Run `npm run audit:circle`
   - Run `npm run audit:clips`
   - Run `npm run audit:launchpad`
   - Run `npm run audit:lens`
   - Run `npm run audit:stand`
   - Run `npm run audit:voice`
   - Run `npm run audit:website`

3. **Commit all changes**:

   - Commit with meaningful message
   - Push to remote repository

### Short-term

1. Install Jest and Axios dependencies
2. Run localhost:3000 tests
3. Set up CI/CD for automated audits
4. Expand test coverage as needed
5. Document any new workflows discovered

### Long-term

1. Integrate workflow audits into development workflow
2. Run audits before each release
3. Track pass rates over time
4. Add more test cases as features develop
5. Create automated fix suggestions
