# Chat History Tracking System

This folder contains all chat session logs with timestamps and changes made during each development session.

## Structure

```
.chat-history/
├── sessions/           # Individual session logs
├── CHANGELOG.md        # Cumulative changelog of all changes
├── session-log.js      # Automated logging script
└── README.md          # This file
```

## Session Log Format

Each session file is named: `session_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.md`

### Session Contents Include:

- Session start/end timestamps
- Changes made (files created, modified, deleted)
- Key decisions and implementations
- User requests and responses
- Technical notes and issues resolved

## Usage

### Manual Logging

At the end of each session, you can manually create a session log in the `sessions/` folder.

### Automated Logging

Run the logging script:

```bash
node .chat-history/session-log.js "Session description" "List of changes"
```

### View Recent Sessions

All sessions are stored chronologically in the `sessions/` folder and can be searched by date.

## Best Practices

1. **End of Session**: Always log before closing your development session
2. **Meaningful Descriptions**: Include clear descriptions of what was accomplished
3. **Track Changes**: List all modified files and their purpose
4. **Note Decisions**: Document important architectural or design decisions
