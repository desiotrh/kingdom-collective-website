# 🎯 Stripe Features Setup - CORRECTED

**Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** CORRECTED ✅  
**Issue:** Initially created separate products instead of Stripe Features

## ❌ **What Went Wrong**

We initially created **8 separate products** in Stripe instead of **Stripe Features**:
- Custom Branding (Product ID: `prod_Sme4V99qntiCSe`)
- VoiceBot Integration (Product ID: `prod_Sme46zsHJyJmaO`)
- Dual Tone Toggle (Product ID: `prod_Sme4ZwAIbR3XIm`)
- Memory Engine (Product ID: `prod_Sme4Vum5IYvHSb`)
- Embed Service (Product ID: `prod_Sme44Lfo9h8veR`)
- Basic Analytics (Product ID: `prod_Sme4g0IXfO1Rqn`)
- Legal & Compliance (Product ID: `prod_Sme4jaaQqa1A5y`)
- Stripe/Zapier Setup (Product ID: `prod_Sme4YBHGD2KbJa`)

**These were WRONG because:**
- They appear as separate line items in checkout
- They're not linked to your bot products
- They don't provide the clean feature-based experience

## ✅ **What We Fixed**

1. **Archived the incorrect products** - They're no longer active in your catalog
2. **Updated configuration** - Now uses placeholder feature IDs
3. **Created correct setup instructions** - For proper Stripe Features

## 🎯 **Correct Approach: Stripe Features**

**Stripe Features** are:
- Linked to existing products (your bots)
- Show up as add-ons during checkout
- Provide automatic entitlement tracking
- Create a cleaner checkout experience

## 📋 **Your Next Steps**

### 1. **Create Features in Stripe Dashboard**
1. Go to your Stripe Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Products → Features**
3. Click **"Create feature"** for each add-on

### 2. **Create These 8 Features**
- **Custom Branding** - $50
- **VoiceBot Integration** - $75
- **Dual Tone Toggle** - $40
- **Memory Engine** - $125
- **Embed Service** - $60
- **Basic Analytics** - $100
- **Legal & Compliance** - $30
- **Stripe/Zapier Setup** - $125

### 3. **For Each Feature, Set:**
- **Name:** (e.g., "Custom Branding")
- **Description:** (e.g., "Custom colors, logo, and brand integration")
- **Pricing:** (e.g., $50)
- **Note down the Feature ID** (starts with "feat_")

### 4. **Link Features to Bot Products**
For each of your 14 AI bot products:
1. Go to the bot product (e.g., Sales Assistant Bot)
2. Click **"Add features"**
3. Select relevant features for that bot
4. Set pricing for each feature

### 5. **Update Configuration**
After creating features, update `config/stripe-features.ts`:
```typescript
"custom_branding": {
  "featureId": "feat_custom_branding_123", // Replace with actual feature ID
  "priceId": "price_1Rr4lzGMSZjMrbvl3MYajAyG",
  // ... rest of config
}
```

## 🔧 **Files Updated**

### ✅ **Configuration Files**
- `config/stripe-features.ts` - Updated with placeholder feature IDs
- `stripe-features-correct-template.json` - Correct template

### ✅ **Scripts Created**
- `scripts/setup-stripe-features-correctly.js` - Correct setup instructions
- `scripts/cleanup-incorrect-products.js` - Cleanup script (executed)

## 🎯 **Benefits You'll Get**
